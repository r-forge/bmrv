Description: Provides two Bayesian models for detecting the association between rare genetic variants and a trait that can be continuous, ordinal or binary. Bayesian latent variable collapsing model (BLVCM) detects interaction effect and is dedicated to twin design while it can also be applied to independent samples. Hierarchical Bayesian multiple regression model (HBMR) incorporates genotype uncertainty information and can be applied to either independent or family samples. Furthermore, it deals with continuous, binary and ordinal traits.
